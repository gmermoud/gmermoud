# Greg's website

My personal website is hosted on Firebase and uses Github actions to automatically deploy
the changes when a PR is merged. 

It uses [StartBootstrap - Resume](https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-resume)
as template. 

You can see the live version [here](https://gregorymermoud.ch).
