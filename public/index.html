            My research interests are in the area of domain-informed machine learning, with a focus on hybrid systems that
            combine machine learning with domain knowledge, such as physics-informed neural networks, reinforcement
            learning, and differential programming. I am particularly interested in the intersection of machine learning
            and software systems, especially scientific computing, and how to leverage the power of machine learning to 
            solve complex problems in science and engineering.

                I was the Technical Leader in charge of the machine learning and software development group for
                Stealthwatch Learning Network (SLN), Cisco's next-generation cyber security platform, now known as
                <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/stealthwatch/index.html">
                  Cisco Secure Network Analytics

                . This product turns every router and switch into a security agent capable of analyzing the behavior of
                every host and device on the network and triggering alerts in case of anomalies.

                My teams have always thought that building software that meets both customer requirements (by solving a
                key problem) and deadlines is possible. We have been historically pretty successful in doing so, and we
                strive to improve even further. This handbook introduces the foundational ideas and principles that have
                helped us in the past, and that we are committed to live by in the future.

                There is a subtle, yet fundamental reason why automation is a key ingredient in the success of AI in
                networking and many other areas: causality. Note: the article is divided into
